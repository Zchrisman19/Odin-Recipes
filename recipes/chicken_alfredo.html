    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettuccine</li>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Herbs & Spices</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps in cooking</h4>
    <Ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta just until al dente. Season chicken with olive oil, herbs, and spices.</li><br>  
        <li>Cook chicken in a large saute pan for about 4-7 minutes per side or until a golden brown crust forms on the outside and the chicken is cooked through on the inside.<br> Let chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice.</li><br> 
        <li>Cut butter into 8 slices, add to the large skillet, and reduce heat to low. Add garlic and cook for 30-60 seconds, stirring frequently. Do not allow garlic to brown!</li><br>  
        <li>Whisk in heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.</li><br>  
        <li>Reduce heat to low or medium-low and simmer gently (do not boil!), whisking frequently, for about 3-4 minutes or until it thickens slightly. It should easily coat the back of a spoon.</li><br>  
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li><br>  
        <li>Stir until the cheese melts.</li><br> 
        <li>Add cooked pasta and toss to coat evenly. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li><br> 
        <li>Add chicken and return to medium-low heat for a couple minutes or until everything is warmed through.</li><br>  
        <li>Garnish with chopped parsley (and a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like) and serve!</li><br>
